Proton decay code


Only pion channel dimension 5 operator implemented
To execute python3 protondecay.py
It is possible to directly give him the results of the scan just by modifying the name of the folder at line 38 of the main file protondecay.py

To install download the file, go in the main folder and install with pip install . 

Channels folder contains all channels, the notation follows the one of reference 1506.08468
Breaking chain compute the factors AS1 and AS2

Need to add Knuchannel.py using pionchannel as template

The folder used for the example is too big, remind me to send it in a different way if you need it, it is the output folder of GUTFIT
